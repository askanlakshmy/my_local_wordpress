                                    <p>Hair Transplant has proved to be a life-changing experience for so many people. But, it’s essential to carefully follow all the instructions of surgeons before and after the transplant. The healing process takes quite a time after the surgery. When your hair starts growing naturally, any grey hair in it can potentially dampen your newly established self-esteem. You can colour your hair after a hair transplant. But you need to remember one thing, your scalp is susceptible and fragile at this point. Applying harsh chemicals, bleaching agents, and peroxides might irritate your scalp and impair your newly implanted grafts. This can hamper your recovery process and the quality of transplanted hair. Therefore, we will advise you to wait for a period of four to six weeks before dying or colouring your hair. Your scalp gets enough time to heal considerably and allow the implants to fix firmly to your roots. </p>

Setting the right expectations for both recovery and outcome can help a lot.&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>After the hair transplant procedure, there may be slight discomfort. But, it can be easily controlled and treated with medication. It's important to note that initially, the results will be less visible. It will take around 4 to 6 months to notice the expected results.
